# Enviromental_justice

Environmental Justice Mexico is a platform where you can find environmental injustices in Mexico through environmental injustices map section. Also, we have an animation and data analysis section where we present animations of satellite images and data analysis of two different regions in Mexico to make a comparison and get conclusions to know if there is an environmental justice. 
Information we have is not enough, because of this, we create a forum where the people who knows about environmental injustices could act and publish their complaints. We are following social media through News Social injustice section to know where there are more environmental injustices.

### Justice Enviromental Map Section
